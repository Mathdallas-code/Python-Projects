# Uses the pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between two points on a 2D plane.
# The points are represented as tuples of two numbers.
# The function should return a float.

# Sample :- startX = 0, startY = 0, endX = 3, endY = 4. 
# So, according to pythagorean theorem, the distance between these two points is 5.0.

# Hope this helps!
